Organize your user interface better!

## What does libkinetic do? How does it work?
Libkinetic reads an XML file that lists the user interface plan in your plugin. The main goal is to apply a view/controller framework in your plugin, where view (client interface) is completely handled by libkinetic (with dual support of command interface and forms interface) and controller (program logic) is written as separate classes in the plugin source code.
